## Information

- The reducers allow us to have well-organized states -> they are used to scale the application
- Reducer: A function that receives an initial state, receives an action to generate some change, and returns a modified state

## Rules
- It can't do asynchronous actions
- It only makes the changes to the state object

## Extra Data
- Payload -> Load that will be implemented on the initial state to return a modified state

This project was initialized with React + Vite.
